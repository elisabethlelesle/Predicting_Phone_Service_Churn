<h1>Predicting Phone Service Churn</h1>
<p>A CSE204 project - Introduction to Machine Learning</p>

<h2>
Highlights:
</h2>
FoodSaver was designed as an app and a server that is meant to connect from one another. The development of the project has been undertaken through several subprojects:
<li><b>Classification problem</b>: predicting which customers will churn (leave for another similar service)</li>
<li><b>Models used</b>: KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision trees (+variants), Naive Bayes, CNN</li>
<li><b>Supervised learning</b></li>
<li><b>Created a Decision Tree class in Python</b>: better results than scikit learn</li>
<li><b>Different performance metrics</b>: Accuracy, f1 score, confusion matrices</li>

Brief Report:
</h2>
The primary goal of this project was to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By anticipating customer churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers, thereby reducing turnover rates and increasing profitability.
We used a number of classification methods that were presented in the course, and others that werenâ€™t. We then compared their performance using different accuracy metrics.

Dataset key features include:
<li>Customer demographics (age, gender, etc.)</li>
<li>Account information (contract type, tenure, etc.)</li>
<li>Service usage statistics (number of calls, internet usage, etc.)</li>
<li>Customer support interactions</li>
<li>Payment and billing information</li>
